Description of the dataset: 
    1) All binding data used in the paper: BD2009, BD2013, and Blind.
    2) For BD2009 data set, three cross-validation data partitions were generated: cv_rnd, cv_sr, and cv_gs.
    3) Predictions made by the three methods for the cross-validation and blind data sets.
    4) FILE_S1: Prediction performances for SMMPMBEC, NetMHC, and NetMHCpan against cv_rnd, cv_sr, cv_gs, and Blind data sets. An R script that constructs logistic regression models of deviations (i.e. |cv - blind|) is also included.


Date of the dataset generation: 2014

Details on the dataset generation: 
    BD2009 and BD2013 refer to MHC-I binding data files compiled in 2009 and 2013. Blind data sets refer to data resulting after subtracting BD2009 from BD2013.

    In the paper, different cross-validation strategies (i.e. cv_rnd, cv_sr, and cv_gs) were tested. Please see the Methods section for details of the cross-validation strategies.
