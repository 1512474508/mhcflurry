# MHCflurry documentation

To generate Sphinx documentation, from this directory run:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt  # for the first time you generate docs
$ make rst html
```

The above command will also regenerate `docs/readme.generated.md`. The main
[README.md](../README.md) is symlinked to this file.

Files in this directory that start with an "_" are also generated by
the command given above. These files should not be checked into the repo.
