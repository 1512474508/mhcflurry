# MHCflurry documentation

To generate Sphinx documentation, from this directory run:

```
$ make rst html
```

You may have to pip install `Sphinx` and `numpydoc` first.

The above command will also regenerate `docs/_readme.md`. The main
[README.md](../README.md) is symlinked to this file.

Any other files in this directory that start with an "_" are also generated by
the command given above. Except for `_readme.md` these files should not be
checked into the repo.
