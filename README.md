# mhcflurry
[MHC I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_I) ligand
prediction package with competitive accuracy and a fast and 
[documented](http://openvax.github.io/mhcflurry/) implementation.

MHCflurry implements class I peptide/MHC binding affinity prediction. By default
it supports 112 MHC alleles using ensembles of allele-specific models.
Pan-allele predictors supporting virtually any MHC allele of known sequence
are available for testing. MHCflurry runs on Python 2.7 and 3.4+ using the
[keras](https://keras.io) neural network library.
It exposes [command-line](http://openvax.github.io/mhcflurry/commandline_tutorial.html)
and [Python library](http://openvax.github.io/mhcflurry/python_tutorial.html)
interfaces.

## Installation (pip)

Install the package:

```
$ pip install mhcflurry
```

Then download our datasets and trained models:

```
$ mhcflurry-downloads fetch
```

You can now generate predictions:

```
$ mhcflurry-predict \
       --alleles HLA-A0201 HLA-A0301 \
       --peptides SIINFEKL SIINFEKD SIINFEKQ \
       --out /tmp/predictions.csv
       
Wrote: /tmp/predictions.csv
```

See the [documentation](http://openvax.github.io/mhcflurry/) for more details.

## Allele-specific models and mass spec

The default MHCflurry models are trained on affinity measurements, one allele
per model (i.e. allele-specific). Mass spec datasets are incorporated in the
model selection step.

We also release experimental allele-specific predictors whose training data
directly includes mass spec. To download these predictors, run:

```
$ mhcflurry-downloads fetch models_class1_trained_with_mass_spec
```

and then to make them used by default:

```
$ export MHCFLURRY_DEFAULT_CLASS1_MODELS="$(mhcflurry-downloads path models_class1_trained_with_mass_spec)/models"
```

We also release predictors that do not use mass spec datasets at all. To use
these predictors, run:

```
$ mhcflurry-downloads fetch models_class1_selected_no_mass_spec
export MHCFLURRY_DEFAULT_CLASS1_MODELS="$(mhcflurry-downloads path models_class1_selected_no_mass_spec)/models"
```

### Pan-allele models (experimental)

We are testing new models that support prediction for any MHC I allele of known
sequence (as opposed to the 112 alleles supported by the allele-specific
predictors). These models are trained on both affinity measurements and mass spec.

To try the pan-allele models, first download them:

```
$ mhcflurry-downloads fetch models_class1_pan
```

then set this environment variable to use them by default:

```
$ export MHCFLURRY_DEFAULT_CLASS1_MODELS="$(mhcflurry-downloads path models_class1_pan)/models.with_mass_spec"
```

You can now generate predictions for about 14,000 MHC I alleles. For example:

```
$ mhcflurry-predict --alleles HLA-A*02:04 --peptides SIINFEKL
```

If you use these models please let us know how it goes and if you encounter
anything surprising.

### Optimizations

The pan-allele models are somewhat slow. You can set
the environment variable `MHCFLURRY_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL=1` to turn on one
attempt to optimize these models for faster prediction speed. This will
"stitch" the pan-allele models in the ensemble (currently 32) into one large
tensorflow (or theano) graph. In our experiments it gives about a 30% speed
improvement. It has no effect on allele-specific models.

For large prediction tasks, it can be helpful to increase the prediction
batch size, which is set by the `MHCFLURRY_DEFAULT_PREDICT_BATCH_SIZE`
environment variable. The default is 4096. This affects both allele-specific
and pan-allele predictors. It can result in large performance increases if you
have sufficient memory.
