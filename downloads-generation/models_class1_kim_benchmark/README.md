# Kim benchmark

This download trains MHCflurry predictors using the BD2009 dataset from 
[Dataset size and composition impact the reliability of performance benchmarks for peptide-MHC binding predictions](http://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-15-241). The trained predictor can be evaluated on the BLIND test set from this publication.

We include this download as a resource for others wishing to benchmark new
binding predictors. It's also a working example of a complete MHCflurry
training and model selection run on a simple dataset. See
[GENERATE.sh](./GENERATE.sh).
