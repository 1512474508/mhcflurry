# Prediction of antigen presention

This submodule contains predictors for naturally presented MHC ligands. These predictors are typically trained on peptides eluted from cell surfaces and identified with mass-spec. The models combine MHC binding affinity with cleavage prediction and the level of expression of transcripts containing the given peptide.

This is a work in progress and not ready for production use.
